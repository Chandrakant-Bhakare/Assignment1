Assignment 1
Problem 1: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is
any need to insert some data then do that as well.
a) Navigate and List:
	a. Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a
	directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it..
	Ans- mkdir LinuxAssignment
b) File Management:
	a. Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its
	contents.
	Ans-cat > file1.txt Hello World
c) Directory Management:
	a. Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory.
	Ans- mkdir docs
d) Copy and Move Files:
	a. Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".
	Ans - cp file1.txt docs
e) Permissions and Ownership:
	a. Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for
	the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to
	the current user.
	Ans- chmod 744 file2.txt
f) Final Checklist:
	a. Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to
	ensure that all operations were performed correctly.
	Ans- ls /
	g) File Searching:
	a. Search for all files with the extension ".txt" in the current directory and its subdirectories.
	Ans- find . -name "*.txt"
	b. Display lines containing a specific word in a file (provide a file name and the specific
word to search).
	Ans-grep "Hello" file2.txt
	Hello World
h) System Information:
	a. Display the current system date and time.
	Ans-date
i) Networking:
	a. Display the IP address of the system.
	Ans- ifconfig
	b. Ping a remote server to check connectivity (provide a remote server address to ping).
	Ans- ping 127.0.0.1
j) File Compression:
	a. Compress the "docs" directory into a zip file.
	Ans- zip -r docs1.zip docs
	b. Extract the contents of the zip file into a new directory.
	Ans- unzip docs1.zip -d New
k) File Editing:
	a. Open the "file1.txt" file in a text editor and add some text to it.
	Ans- open vi editor vi file1
	Esc i
	echo "Add Text Chandrakant"
	Esc :wq Enter
	
	b. Replace a specific word in the "file1.txt" file with another word (provide the original
	word and the word to replace it with).
	Ans - sed -i 's/Chandrakant/Abhishek/g' file1
Problem 2: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is
any need to insert some data then do that as well.
	a. Suppose you have a file named "data.txt" containing important information. Display the first 10 lines of this file to quickly glance at its contents using a command.
	Ans- cat > data.txt

e. Imagine you have a file named "input.txt" with text content. Use a command to translate
all lowercase letters to uppercase in "input.txt" and save the modified text in a new file
named "output.txt."
	Ans- cat > input.txt 
	a b c d e f g 
	cat input.txt | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]
	A B C D E F G 
	tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' <input.txt> output.txt
f. In a file named "duplicate.txt," there are several lines of text, some of which are
duplicates. Use a command to display only the unique lines from "duplicate.txt."
	Ans- cat > duplicate.txt
